\section{Presentation}
Dear recruiters,

\if \cvtype d
%developer
{\quad}I've been working as a developer for over five years, programming mainly in \textbf{C++} and \textbf{Java} but also \textbf{Python} and \textbf{Rust}, among others. I have experience in many other technologies, and also in leadership roles and teaching. What I enjoy the most in programming is documenting, writing unit tests and refactoring legacy code. My extensive background in Mathematics, Science and Education sometimes comes in handy.

{\quad}My goal is to learn as much as possible. Software development is a field where there are many multi disciplinary projects with a lot different subjects and technologies to learn about. I also work on personal projects when I have the time. I try to use these projects also to come into contact with technologies I have not yet been able to work professionally with, such as game engines and many interesting libraries and frameworks.

\textsc{January 2020} & Developer and Scrum Master at \textsc{Critical Techworks}\\
\textsc{Current} & Development of software used for testing and quality assurance of BMW embedded software, such as a test framework written in C++ and a CI website with Java backend. After a year or so I also started acting as the Scrum Master for my team. We use technologies such as GTest, Git, SVN, Postgresql, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Docker, Saltstack and Openstack. I also take part in many company activities, mainly the Rust Community of Practice (a group co-created by me to study and talk about Rust, with weekly sessions) and the C++ daily (a 15 min meeting open to the whole company where we talk about anything related to C++).\\

\multicolumn{2}{c}{}\\


\textsc{June 2019} & Consultant at \textsc{Natixis} through \textsc{Altran}\\
\textsc{December 2019} & I worked on a financial software called Summit. The software was written in C++, but there were also many scripts in Python. We used technologies such as GTest, XLDeploy, Git, Jenkins, Bitbucket and Jira. I was also one of the leaders of the Craftsman Academy, a weekly session that consisted of a short presentation followed by mob programming.\\

\multicolumn{2}{c}{}\\

\textsc{March 2016} & Systems analyst at \textsc{Brazilian Navy Research Institute}\\
\textsc{March 2019} & Development of a ship's engine room simulator for the Mercantile Navy\\&
\footnotesize{Responsible for the control module (C++), mantaining the mathematical models (C++/Fortran) and communication between these components and the graphical interface (Java);}\\&
\footnotesize{Also reponsible for the test module (C++/Java), which uses a .json file to simulate user operations and verifies the outcomes given by the models. It also checked the validity of \textsc{fxml}, \textsc{xml} and the database (Postgres). These tests were run using Gitlab's CI.}\\&
\footnotesize{Modifications on the database (pgSQL), graphical interfaces (JavaFx) and model analysis (\textsc{xml}, Simulink).}\\
